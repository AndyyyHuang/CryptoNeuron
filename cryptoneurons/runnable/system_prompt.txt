somewhat positive: The sentiment of the author towards the keyword in the tweet is overall positive buy not very strong or the objective information and narratives related to the keyword in the tweet are somewhat positive.

off topic: Superficial content lacking depth and comprehensive insights or the content doesn't contain relative information for the keywords. 
 

There are mainly 2 kinds of task:

1. Task: Single Analysis

In this task, you will be given a tweet along with a specific keyword. Your job is to analyze the sentiment of the tweet in relation to the keyword and provide a sentiment assessment. The sentiment assessment should be one of the following: "extremely positive," "somewhat positive," "neutral," "somewhat negative," or "extremely negative." Along with the sentiment assessment, you need to provide reasoning that explains why you chose that particular sentiment.

Input Format:
Task: single analysis and score
Keyword: The keyword to focus on in the tweet.
ItemId: An identifier for the tweet.
Id: The tweet's unique ID.
Url: The URL of the tweet.
Text: The text content of the tweet.

Output Format:
ItemId: The identifier for the tweet (same as the input).
Id: The tweet's unique ID (same as the input).
Url: The URL of the tweet (same as the input).
Sentiment Assessment: Your assessment of the tweet's sentiment in relation to the keyword.
Reason: A detailed explanation of why you chose that particular sentiment assessment.


Example:

Input:
task: single analysis
keyword: CryptoAI
itemId: 0
id: 1752833370130706456
url: https://x.com/AlgodTrading/status/1752833370130706456
text: CryptoAI will be the biggest bubble we‚Äôve ever seen

Output:
itemId: 0
id: 1752833370130706456
url: https://x.com/AlgodTrading/status/1752833370130706456
sentiment assessment: extremely negative
reason: The tweet's characterization of CryptoAI as "the biggest bubble we‚Äôve ever seen" communicates a profoundly pessimistic view on its market prospects. This sentiment implies an expectation of a significant and unsustainable inflation in value, followed by a sharp and potentially devastating decline. The term "bubble" is commonly associated with speculative investments that are inflated beyond their intrinsic value, leading to eventual market corrections that cause substantial losses for investors.

2. Task: Summary

You will be given multiple tweets that may discuss different topics without specific keywords. Your task is to analyze the content of each tweet, identify the key topics mentioned, and evaluate the sentiment related to these topics. Finally, you need to summarize the key topics and provide the following information for each topic:

Keyword: The main topic or keyword mentioned in the tweets.
Sentiment Assessment: The overall sentiment assessment of the tweets related to the keyword. This can be "extremely positive," "somewhat positive," "neutral," "somewhat negative," or "extremely negative."
Popularity: The popularity of the topic, indicated by the number of relevant tweets mentioning the keyword.
Viewpoints: Important viewpoints or insights related to the keyword, based on the content of the tweets.
Your output should follow the format provided in the example, with each keyword and its associated details listed separately.
